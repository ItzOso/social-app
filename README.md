# Social Media App

A basic social media app built with React, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. Users can sign up, log in, create posts, and interact with each other's content.

## Features

- User Authentication with Firebase
- Firestore for database
- Create, read, and delete posts
- Like and comment on posts
- View users profiles
- Update your profile(edit bio, upload pfp)
- Follow/ unfollow users

*App is not configured for scaling(all posts are loaded and all users are loaded on sidebars, if there were more users it would be chaos)*
